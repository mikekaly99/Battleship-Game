Developer Notes

I started building this to explore C++ and experiment with console visuals, game logic, and user interaction. I still haven't mastered everything I wrote—Google and W3Schools were always on the background but I’ve had a blast making it.

Whether you're here to play or peek at the code, I hope you enjoy the experience. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
